# Cast

Target shape, after Duolingo: **one main character and six side characters**. The product is known by the main character. Each side character has a stable identity of its own and never competes with the main one.

**Nothing is final.** The drawings from Sparkles’ `/design/nix` bench are starting points, not finished characters. The 52 practice-item characters, the human candidates, Mabel and the koala are not part of the cast.

## One ability per character

Every character has **one special feature or ability that no other character in the cast has**. It is what the character is remembered by, and what it can do on screen that no one else can. Two characters must never share an ability, and a new candidate needs one before it is drawn.

| Character | Ability |
|---|---|
| Firefly (Wisp line) | Glow, and the sparks it leaves behind as it flies |
| Chameleon | Colour change: it takes the colour of what it lands on, including semantic colours |

## Main character: Wisp (decided)

The firefly is the natural fit for the main character, because Sparkles’ guide is a small light. The bench drawing is too plain. It needs a heavy rework into a more detailed, sturdier character that holds up under costumes, props and movement.

### Colour

A character has no colours of its own. Every firefly draws with the product’s **primary** and **accent** (`src/design/nix/theme.ts`), and in Sparkles those are the product’s own tokens. The studio header switches the scheme for every character at once, and a custom pair can be picked. *Sparkles* is the product’s light-mode primary and accent, fixed, so a character keeps its colour on both grounds instead of following the lighter dark-mode primary. Deeper and lighter shades are derived from the primary in `studio.css`. **The glow is the one fixed colour**, because it is the firefly’s ability. Never make per-character colourways.

The product’s current accent is a yellow close to the glow. In the Sparkles scheme, clothes drawn in it sit right against the light and the two blur, so the glow stops standing apart. Deciding what clothes are drawn in (the accent, a deep primary, or a neutral) is still open.

### Outlines

**Decision: no black outlines.** Shapes are told apart by colour and tone, the way Duolingo’s characters are: flat shapes, no black line around them. A black line also disappears on the dark ground, which is what made the antennae vanish. Where an edge is needed, it is a shade of the part’s own colour, never black:

| Where | Edge |
|---|---|
| The body and limbs, and clothes on them | A translucent dark (`C.line`) that reads as a deeper shade of whatever it lies on; soft on either ground |
| Pale parts that meet a pale ground: wings, Wisp’s head | A mid shade of the product colour (`C.hi`) |
| The glow | Its own deeper amber (`C.glowEdge`) |
| Thin parts drawn as a line: antennae | No outline; the line is drawn in `C.thin`, the body colour on light and a lighter shade on dark |
| Eyes, mouth, brows | Stay dark ink: they sit on the cream face, which is the same on both grounds |

In the rig, `Palette.line` is the outline colour for the body, limbs, clothes and props; `Palette.ink` is kept for the face’s features. The reference drawings and bench animals still use black outlines.

### Wisp

**Wisp is the main character.** It floats with no legs, has a droplet head, and its body ends in a flame of light. Its variants are in `src/design/nix/firefly-wisp.tsx`, with the original as the base:

| Variant | What is different |
|---|---|
| Wisp | The original: a near-white spirit with ribbon wings and a long flame. It looks whitish on the dark ground |
| Moth | Two pairs of round wings with eyespots; a short flame curled like a comma |
| True colour | Colour-corrected: the head shades from a light centre to the product’s mid-tone, and the body and limbs take the primary. It reads as a colour on both grounds |
| Solid | Opaque and flat in the primary, with a cream face patch. Only the wings and the glow’s halo are translucent |
| Curly | True colour, with Pip’s coiled-spring antennae |

True colour has **no outline on its head**: the gradient runs from a light centre to the primary at the rim, so the colour itself is the edge.

**New wispy directions**, drawn from scratch rather than from the droplet. Each floats and puts its light somewhere of its own. Round one is in `src/design/nix/firefly-spirits.tsx`:

| Variant | Shape | Where the light is |
|---|---|---|
| Puff | A cloud: a head of puffs, a cloud body, a trail of puffs thinning out behind | At its core, in the chest, through any outfit |
| Jelly | A jellyfish bell with a frilled rim, and tendrils beneath | At the tip of every tendril |
| Bloom | A bellflower: a crown of petals, a petal skirt, leaf wings | Hanging below the petals like a stamen, a lamp it carries |

Round two is in `src/design/nix/firefly-spirits-2.tsx`:

| Variant | Shape | Where the light is |
|---|---|---|
| Comet | A round head with a mane of light swept back | The mane itself; sparks peel off its end |
| Bubble | A soap-bubble head around a coloured heart; a smaller bubble for a body | A light floating at the core of the body bubble |
| Dandelion | A parachute of filaments over its head, a slim stem | The seed at the bottom |
| Star | A plush five-pointed star with a cream face; no rig arms | Its two lower points |
| Crescent | A small moon whose body curls round from behind its head | The pearl it cradles in the curve |

**Wings move as two pairs.** Where a character has upper and lower wings, the upper pair rides `wingL`/`wingR` and the lower pair `hindL`/`hindR`. The upper pair strokes slowly; the lower pair beats twice to each stroke, half a beat behind. The two pairs are never one piece.

### Reference

Kept as inspiration for the main character or a side character, not as candidates. If one inspires a side character, redraw it as a different species with its own ability.

| Variant | File | Idea worth keeping |
|---|---|---|
| Pip, Wing cases, Plump | `firefly-pip.tsx` | The bean that stands; a glow at its bottom through any outfit; wing cases over flying wings |
| Fuzzy | `firefly-variants.tsx` | Fuzz, a ruff and feathery antennae: the most huggable firefly |
| Chonk | `firefly-bodies.tsx` | A low, wide body in a domed shell; lamps set into the shell |
| Cube | `firefly-bodies-2.tsx` | Everything square; a lit window in the chest |
| Hood | `firefly-bodies-2.tsx` | A cone of a cloak, a floppy hood, light from inside the cloak |

Dropped: Lantern, Spark, Flicker, Nightlight, Bulb, Glowworm, Strider, Flutter, Lampion, Trio; Pip’s per-character colourways; the Pip × Wisp hybrids (Droplet, Flame-top, Comet); Pip · Cap; Wisp · Swirl.

The antennae and glow follow the expression: they droop and dim when worried, perk up and brighten when delighted, and one antenna lifts when curious. The rig passes the mood to each character’s parts through `Ctx.mood`.

The original bench firefly stays in `candidates.tsx` for reference. **Next step:** pick one variant, or combine parts of several. Motion and extra poses wait until a variant is chosen.

**The spark trail is the firefly’s ability.** Every Wisp-line character leaves glowing sparks behind as it flies. It is the one thing kept from the bench firefly. It is drawn once, by the rig (`rig/sparks.tsx`), and never painted into a drawing. A character names where its sparks come from with `trail`. The sparks drift down and back from that point, shrink and fade on declared keyframes, and are left behind rather than carried by the body. Stilled, or under reduced motion, they show as a frozen trail. **Every other flourish** (bursts, confetti, celebration effects) is still a separate layer, to be designed later for any character.

Once one is chosen, the main character’s silhouette, palette and ability stay fixed across every context. Only pose, expression and authored wardrobe change. The glow is its signature, not a status.

## Side characters

| # | Character | Ability | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chameleon | Colour change | **Confirmed.** The design itself can still be reworked |
| — | Otter | (a glowing pebble; too close to the firefly’s glow — needs its own ability) | Backup, no preference |
| — | Red panda | (none yet — the ringed tail is a look, not an ability) | Backup, no preference |
| 2–6 | — | — | Open: new candidates are to be proposed in this repo |

## Cast structure: recommended, not decided

Recommended: **one firefly as the main character, and every side character a different species.** No second firefly.

- **The ability rule.** Glow is the firefly’s one ability. A second firefly either shares it, which breaks the rule, or glows differently, which weakens what the main character is known for.
- **Recognition.** A child names the character the product is known by. Two or three fireflies turn “the firefly” into “which firefly?”, and the main one stops being the face of the product.
- **Duolingo’s shape.** Duo is the only owl. The rest of the cast are different species and people, each told apart by silhouette alone.
- **The loser variants are not wasted.** Several of the body plans already carry a side character’s idea without being a firefly. A domed shell (Chonk), a cloak and hood (Hood), a floating spirit (Wisp) or a square toy (Cube) can be redrawn as another species with its own ability.

One exception is worth keeping open: **a younger firefly-family member** (a glowworm, say) as the learner’s companion. It would need an ability other than glow, and a story that never turns growing up into a reward. Decide this only after the main firefly is chosen.

A side character must be told apart from the main character and from every other side character by silhouette alone, at small size.

Which side character plays which role in the product is not decided. Record it here when it is.

### The chameleon’s colour change

Colour change is the chameleon’s ability, and it is meant to be semantic: green for a correct answer, a “not yet” colour for an incorrect one, and other meaningful colours where the product defines them. This is a deliberate exception to the brief’s “no large field in a status hue” rule, and it applies **only** to the chameleon. It carries three conditions:

- The colour is never the only signal. The outcome is also given in words or a status mark (see the brief).
- An incorrect answer is still gentle. A harsh alarm-red body can read as a scold to a child, so the incorrect colour needs to be tested and may need to be a softer hue.
- At rest, the chameleon wears its own non-status colour. It changes colour only on one of the three practice events.
